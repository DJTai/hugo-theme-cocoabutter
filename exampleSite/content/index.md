Hello! Welcome to my personal website.

This site is built with [Hugo](http://gohugo.io). It uses the [cocoabutter](https://github.com/vickylaixy/cocoabutter-hugo-theme) theme, which is forked from the [cocoa](https:////github.com/nishanths/cocoa-hugo-theme) theme. The posts are written in Markdown.

The primary font face is Open Sans and the monospace font face is Ubuntu Mono. The social icons are from the Ionicons font set. CSS classes for code syntax highlighting are inserted during compile-time by Hugo using Pygments.

This is the end of the sample index.md page!
